# Trust Talk --> Platform

1. Define **Vision**
1. Define a single **Boundary**
1. Define **Acceptence Criteria**
1. Do it loop:
    1. Deliver once
    1. Document the process
    1. Get feedback
    1. Loop until customer is happy
1. Create an asynchronous **Interface**
1. Measure time from request to delivery
1. Publish SLI/SLOs
1. Automate loop:
    1. Map inputs and outputs from steps in the do-it loop
    1. Determine if the step could provide value outside this flow
    1. Automate the slowest step in the value stream
    1. Loop until all steps in the value steam are automated
1. Be idle: reflect on vision/boundaries and expand scope as neccessary


## Vision
Vision is a combination of two equally important things. An understanding of where, within the context of a larger system, the product/service fits and a value proposition for why it exists. 

### Where

## Boundaries

### Vague
### Gaps
### Overlaps
